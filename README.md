# use d3 with react

![](./vase-gif.gif)

### the challenge

put all your code in the App.js file.
It should have the same functionality as it had before it used react.
Everything that you only want to happen once (for example creating the svg, and the shapes that dont change) you want to create in componentDidMount. The code that draws the shapes that will change need to be in a separate 'draw' function that can be called when required.
Think about how the what should trigger the update function...

### to run the app for development

in root

```
npm run dev-server
```
